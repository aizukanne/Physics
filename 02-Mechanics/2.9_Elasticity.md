### 2.9 Elasticity

Elasticity is the property of solid materials to return to their original shape and size after the removal of external forces that caused deformation. Understanding elasticity is crucial in material science and engineering.

**Stress and Strain**

When external forces are applied to a solid object, they cause internal forces within the material and deformation. We quantify these using stress and strain:

1.  **Stress (σ):** A measure of the internal forces acting within a deformable body per unit area. It quantifies the intensity of the internal forces.
    *   `Stress (σ) = Force (F) / Cross-sectional Area (A)`
    *   Where `F` is the force acting perpendicular to the cross-sectional area `A`.
    *   The SI unit of stress is the **pascal (Pa)** or N/m², the same as pressure.
    *   Types of stress include tensile (stretching), compressive (squeezing), and shear (tangential).

2.  **Strain (ε):** A measure of the deformation of the material in response to stress. It's a dimensionless quantity, often expressed as a ratio or percentage.
    *   **Tensile/Compressive Strain (ε) = Change in Length (ΔL) / Original Length (L₀)**
    *   `ε = ΔL / L₀`
    *   Shear strain involves the change in angle of deformation.

Label F, A, L₀, and ΔL clearly to illustrate tensile stress and strain. Add using `![Tensile Stress and Strain](assets/02-9_stress_strain_tensile.png)`)*

**Hooke's Law and Elastic Modulus**

For many materials, within a certain limit (the **elastic limit**), stress is directly proportional to strain. This linear relationship is a generalization of Hooke's Law.

*   **Stress ∝ Strain**
*   `Stress = Modulus × Strain`

The constant of proportionality is called the **Elastic Modulus** (or Modulus of Elasticity). It's a measure of the material's stiffness or resistance to elastic deformation. A higher modulus indicates a stiffer material.

*   **Young's Modulus (Y or E):** Relates tensile or compressive stress to tensile or compressive strain.
    *   `Y = Tensile Stress / Tensile Strain = (F/A) / (ΔL/L₀)`
    *   Unit: Pascals (Pa).
*   *(Other moduli like Shear Modulus and Bulk Modulus describe resistance to shear and volume changes, respectively.)*

**Elastic Limit and Plastic Deformation**

*   **Elastic Limit:** The maximum stress a material can withstand without undergoing permanent deformation. If the stress is below the elastic limit, the material returns to its original shape when the stress is removed.
*   **Plastic Deformation:** If the stress exceeds the elastic limit, the material undergoes permanent deformation; it does not return completely to its original shape after the stress is removed.
*   **Breaking Stress (Ultimate Tensile Strength):** The maximum stress the material can withstand before fracturing or breaking.

**Stress-Strain Curve**

A graph plotting stress versus strain for a material under load provides valuable information about its elastic and plastic properties.

*(Placeholder for Image: Create an image file (e.g., `02-9_stress_strain_curve.png`) in `02-Mechanics/assets/` showing a typical stress-strain curve for a ductile material. Label the axes (Stress vs. Strain), indicate the proportional limit (where Hooke's Law applies), the elastic limit, the yield point (onset of significant plastic deformation), the ultimate tensile strength, and the fracture point. Add using `![Stress-Strain Curve](assets/02-9_stress_strain_curve.png)`)*

**Elastic Potential Energy**

When an elastic material is deformed, work is done on it, and this work is stored as elastic potential energy within the material (provided the elastic limit is not exceeded).

*   For a material obeying Hooke's Law (like an ideal spring), the stored elastic potential energy (EPE or U<0xE2><0x82><0x91>) when stretched or compressed by `x` is:
    *   `EPE = ½kx²`
*   In terms of stress and strain, the energy stored per unit volume (energy density) in a linearly elastic material is:
    *   `Energy Density = ½ × Stress × Strain = ½ × Y × (Strain)²`

#### Real-World Connections

*   **Material Selection:** Engineers use elastic properties (Young's Modulus, yield strength) to choose appropriate materials for structures (bridges, buildings), machine parts, springs, etc.
*   **Musical Instruments:** The elasticity of strings (guitar, piano) and membranes (drums) determines their vibrational frequencies.
*   **Sports Equipment:** Elasticity is important in tennis rackets, golf clubs, trampolines, and running shoes.
*   **Biology:** Bones, tendons, and cartilage exhibit elastic properties.

#### Key Takeaways

*   Elasticity is the ability of a material to return to its original shape after deformation.
*   Stress (`σ = F/A`) measures internal force intensity; Strain (`ε = ΔL/L₀`) measures relative deformation.
*   Within the elastic limit, stress is proportional to strain (`Stress = Modulus × Strain`). Young's Modulus (`Y`) relates tensile/compressive stress and strain.
*   Beyond the elastic limit, materials undergo permanent (plastic) deformation.
*   Stress-strain curves reveal important material properties like elastic limit, yield strength, and ultimate tensile strength.
*   Deforming an elastic material stores elastic potential energy (`EPE = ½kx²` for springs).
