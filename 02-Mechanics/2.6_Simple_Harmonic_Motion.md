### 2.6 Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)

Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is a special type of periodic motion or oscillation where the restoring force acting on the object is directly proportional to the object's displacement from its equilibrium position and acts in the opposite direction to the displacement.

**Conditions for SHM**

An object undergoes SHM if:
1.  There is an **equilibrium position** where the net force on the object is zero.
2.  When displaced from equilibrium, there is a **restoring force** directed back towards the equilibrium position.
3.  The magnitude of this restoring force (`F_restore`) is directly proportional to the magnitude of the displacement (`x`) from equilibrium: `F_restore ∝ -x`.

**Hooke's Law and Mass-Spring Systems**

A classic example of SHM is a mass attached to an ideal spring (obeying Hooke's Law) on a frictionless horizontal surface.

*   **Hooke's Law:** The force exerted by an ideal spring is proportional to its extension or compression (`x`) from its equilibrium length.
    *   `F_spring = -kx`
    *   Where `k` is the **spring constant** (a measure of the spring's stiffness, unit: N/m) and the negative sign indicates the force opposes the displacement (it's a restoring force).
*   Since `F_restore = -kx`, the condition `F_restore ∝ -x` is met, and the mass-spring system exhibits SHM.

**Key Quantities in SHM**

*   **Equilibrium Position (x=0):** The position where the net force is zero.
*   **Displacement (x):** The position of the object relative to the equilibrium position at any instant.
*   **Amplitude (A):** The maximum magnitude of the displacement from the equilibrium position.
*   **Period (T):** The time taken to complete one full cycle of oscillation.
    *   For a mass-spring system: `T = 2π√(m/k)`
*   **Frequency (f):** The number of cycles completed per unit time.
    *   `f = 1/T = (1/2π)√(k/m)`
    *   Unit: Hertz (Hz).
*   **Angular Frequency (ω):** Related to frequency and period. It represents the rate of change of the phase of the oscillation.
    *   `ω = 2πf = 2π/T = √(k/m)` (for mass-spring)
    *   Unit: radians per second (rad/s).

**Equations of Motion for SHM**

The displacement `x`, velocity `v`, and acceleration `a` of an object undergoing SHM can be described as functions of time `t`:

*   **Displacement:** `x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ)` or `x(t) = A sin(ωt + φ)`
    *   `A` is the amplitude.
    *   `ω` is the angular frequency.
    *   `φ` is the **phase constant** (or phase angle), determined by the initial conditions (position and velocity at t=0).
*   **Velocity:** `v(t) = dx/dt = -Aω sin(ωt + φ)` (if using cosine for x)
    *   Maximum speed `v_max = Aω` (occurs at equilibrium, x=0).
*   **Acceleration:** `a(t) = dv/dt = d²x/dt² = -Aω² cos(ωt + φ)` (if using cosine for x)
    *   `a(t) = -ω²x` (This shows `a ∝ -x`, the defining condition for SHM).
    *   Maximum acceleration `a_max = Aω²` (occurs at maximum displacement, x=±A).

Add using `![Graphs of SHM](assets/02-6_shm_graphs.png)`)*

**Energy in SHM**

The total mechanical energy (`E_total`) of an object in SHM is conserved (assuming no friction or damping). It continuously transforms between kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE).

*   **Potential Energy (PE):** For a mass-spring system, this is the elastic potential energy.
    *   `PE = ½kx² = ½k(A cos(ωt + φ))²`
*   **Kinetic Energy (KE):**
    *   `KE = ½mv² = ½m(-Aω sin(ωt + φ))²`
*   **Total Mechanical Energy (E_total):**
    *   `E_total = KE + PE = ½kA² = ½mv_max²`
    *   The total energy is constant and proportional to the square of the amplitude.

**The Simple Pendulum**

A simple pendulum consists of a point mass (bob) `m` suspended by a massless, inextensible string of length `L`. For *small* angular displacements (θ), a simple pendulum approximates SHM.

*   The restoring force is the component of gravity tangential to the path: `F_restore = -mg sin(θ)`.
*   For small angles (θ in radians), `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. Also, `θ ≈ x/L` where `x` is the arc length displacement.
*   So, `F_restore ≈ -mg(x/L) = -(mg/L)x`. This fits the `F ∝ -x` form.
*   **Angular Frequency (ω):** `ω = √(g/L)`
*   **Period (T):** `T = 2π/ω = 2π√(L/g)`
    *   Note: The period of a simple pendulum (for small angles) depends only on its length and the acceleration due to gravity, *not* on the mass of the bob.

**Damped Oscillations and Resonance**

*   **Damped Oscillations:** In real systems, friction or other resistive forces cause the amplitude of oscillations to decrease over time (energy is dissipated).
*   **Resonance:** Occurs when a system capable of oscillating is driven by a periodic external force at a frequency close to its own natural frequency. This leads to a large increase in the amplitude of oscillation.

#### Real-World Connections

*   **Clocks:** Pendulums and balance wheels in mechanical clocks utilize SHM principles.
*   **Musical Instruments:** Vibrating strings (guitar, violin) and air columns (flute, organ pipe) exhibit SHM or related wave phenomena.
*   **Structures:** Buildings and bridges have natural frequencies of oscillation; understanding resonance is crucial to avoid collapse due to external forces (wind, earthquakes).
*   **Shock Absorbers:** Vehicle suspension systems use damping to reduce oscillations after hitting bumps.

#### Key Takeaways

*   SHM occurs when the restoring force is proportional to and opposite the displacement (`F ∝ -x`).
*   Mass-spring systems (`T = 2π√(m/k)`) and simple pendulums for small angles (`T = 2π√(L/g)`) are common examples.
*   Displacement, velocity, and acceleration in SHM vary sinusoidally with time. `a = -ω²x`.
*   Total mechanical energy (`½kA²`) is conserved in ideal SHM, transforming between KE and PE.
*   Damping reduces amplitude over time; resonance occurs when driving frequency matches natural frequency, causing large amplitude.
