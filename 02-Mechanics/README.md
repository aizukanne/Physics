# Chapter 2: Mechanics

Mechanics is the branch of physics concerned with the motion of objects and the forces that cause motion. This chapter explores the fundamental principles governing how things move, from simple linear motion to more complex interactions involving forces, energy, and momentum.

## Topics Covered:

*   **2.1 Motion (Kinematics):** Describing motion using concepts like position, displacement, distance, speed, velocity, and acceleration. Analyzing motion using equations and graphs.
*   **2.2 Forces and Newton's Laws:** Understanding different types of forces (gravity, friction, normal force, tension) and how they affect motion according to Newton's three laws. Analyzing objects in equilibrium.
*   **2.3 Work, Energy, and Power:** Defining work, different forms of energy (kinetic, potential), the principle of conservation of energy, and the rate at which energy is transferred (power).
*   **2.4 Momentum and Collisions:** Exploring linear momentum, impulse, the principle of conservation of momentum, and analyzing different types of collisions.
*   **2.5 Circular Motion:** Analyzing the motion of objects moving in a circle, including concepts like centripetal acceleration and centripetal force.
*   **2.6 Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM):** Investigating oscillatory motion, including the conditions for SHM, Hooke's Law, and the behavior of systems like springs and pendulums.

*(Note: Concepts like Pressure, Elasticity, and Simple Machines may be integrated or covered in subsequent sections as needed.)*
