# Chapter 2: Mechanics

Mechanics is the branch of physics concerned with the motion of objects and the forces that cause motion. This chapter explores the fundamental principles governing how things move, from simple linear motion to more complex interactions involving forces, energy, and momentum. Mechanics forms the foundation for understanding many everyday phenomena and is essential for fields ranging from engineering to sports science.

## Chapter Summary

Mechanics deals with the motion of objects and the forces that influence this motion. The chapter begins with kinematics, which describes motion mathematically without considering its causes. It then introduces dynamics through Newton's laws, which explain how forces affect motion. The concepts of work, energy, and momentum provide powerful alternative approaches to solving mechanical problems. The chapter also explores specialized types of motion (circular and harmonic) and concludes with applications to machines, fluids (pressure), and deformable materials (elasticity). Together, these topics provide a comprehensive foundation for understanding the physical world around us.
