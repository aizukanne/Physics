## Pedagogical Notes

*(Content will relate concepts to everyday experiences (constructivism) and use experiments/simulations for investigation (inquiry-based). Complex problems will be broken down (cognitive load theory), and difficulty will increase gradually (ZPD/scaffolding). Real-world examples include car motion, bridge forces, and roller coaster energy. Labs involve free-fall, dynamics tracks, and collision analysis. Formative assessments include quizzes, group problem-solving, and peer evaluations.)*
