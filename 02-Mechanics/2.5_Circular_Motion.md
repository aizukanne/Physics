### 2.5 Circular Motion

Circular motion describes the movement of an object along a circular path. A common special case is **Uniform Circular Motion (UCM)**, where the object moves at a constant *speed* around the circle.

**Key Concepts in Uniform Circular Motion (UCM)**

Even though the speed is constant in UCM, the **velocity** is continuously changing because the *direction* of motion is changing. This change in velocity means there must be an **acceleration**.

*   **Period (T):** The time taken to complete one full revolution (one circle). Unit: seconds (s).
*   **Frequency (f):** The number of revolutions completed per unit time. Unit: hertz (Hz) or s⁻¹.
    *   `f = 1 / T`
*   **Angular Displacement (Δθ):** The angle swept out by the object relative to the center of the circle. Unit: radians (rad). (2π rad = 360°)
*   **Angular Velocity (ω):** The rate of change of angular displacement. For UCM, it's constant.
    *   `ω = Δθ / Δt = 2π / T = 2πf`
    *   Unit: radians per second (rad/s).
    *   Angular velocity is technically a vector (direction given by the right-hand rule along the axis of rotation), but often treated as a scalar in introductory physics.
*   **Linear (Tangential) Speed (v):** The constant speed of the object along the circular path. It's related to the angular velocity and the radius (`r`) of the circle.
    *   `v = ωr = (2πr) / T`

**Centripetal Acceleration (a<0xE2><0x82><0x84>)**

Since the velocity vector is constantly changing direction (always tangent to the circle), there must be an acceleration. This acceleration is directed towards the *center* of the circle and is called **centripetal acceleration** ("center-seeking").

*   Magnitude of centripetal acceleration:
    *   `a<0xE2><0x82><0x84> = v² / r`
    *   `a<0xE2><0x82><0x84> = ω²r`
*   Direction: Always points radially inward towards the center of the circular path.

Draw the tangential velocity vector **v** and the radially inward centripetal acceleration vector **a<0xE2><0x82><0x84>** at several points on the path. Add using `![Velocity and Acceleration in UCM](assets/02-5_ucm_vectors.png)`)*

**Centripetal Force (F<0xE2><0x82><0x84>)**

According to Newton's Second Law (ΣF = ma), if there is an acceleration, there must be a net force causing it. The net force directed towards the center of the circle, responsible for causing the centripetal acceleration and keeping the object moving in a circle, is called the **centripetal force**.

*   Magnitude of centripetal force:
    *   `F<0xE2><0x82><0x84> = ma<0xE2><0x82><0x84> = mv² / r`
    *   `F<0xE2><0x82><0x84> = mω²r`
*   Direction: Always points radially inward towards the center of the circular path.

**Important Note:** Centripetal force is *not* a new fundamental type of force. It is the *net result* of other real forces (like tension, gravity, friction, normal force) that are acting towards the center. When solving problems, identify the actual force(s) providing the centripetal requirement.

*   *Example:* A ball swung in a circle on a string: Tension in the string provides the centripetal force.
*   *Example:* A car rounding a flat curve: Static friction between tires and road provides the centripetal force.
*   *Example:* A satellite orbiting Earth: Earth's gravitational force provides the centripetal force.

Add using `![Examples of Centripetal Force](assets/02-5_centripetal_force_examples.png)`)*

**Non-Uniform Circular Motion**

If the speed of the object moving in a circle is also changing, there is also a **tangential acceleration (a<0xE1><0xB5><0x9C>)** in addition to the centripetal acceleration (a<0xE2><0x82><0x84>).
*   `a<0xE1><0xB5><0x9C> = dv/dt` (rate of change of speed)
*   The total acceleration vector **a** is the vector sum of **a<0xE2><0x82><0x84>** and **a<0xE1><0xB5><0x9C>**.
*   The net force **ΣF** will also have both a radial (centripetal) component and a tangential component.

#### Real-World Connections

*   **Vehicles Turning:** Friction provides the centripetal force needed to round corners. Banked curves use a component of the normal force.
*   **Satellites and Planets:** Gravitational force provides the centripetal force for orbits.
*   **Centrifuges:** Used in labs and industry to separate substances based on mass by spinning them rapidly (creating large apparent outward force in the rotating frame).
*   **Amusement Park Rides:** Roller coasters (loops), carousels, spinning rides all involve circular motion principles.

#### Practice Problems

*(Placeholder: Add 4-6 practice problems involving calculating period, frequency, angular velocity, linear speed, centripetal acceleration, and identifying/calculating the centripetal force in various scenarios like cars on curves, objects on strings, and simple orbits.)*

#### Key Takeaways

*   Uniform Circular Motion (UCM) involves constant speed but changing velocity (due to changing direction).
*   Objects in UCM experience a centripetal acceleration (**a<0xE2><0x82><0x84> = v²/r = ω²r**) directed towards the center of the circle.
*   A net inward force, the centripetal force (**F<0xE2><0x82><0x84> = ma<0xE2><0x82><0x84> = mv²/r**), is required to maintain circular motion.
*   Centripetal force is provided by other existing forces (tension, friction, gravity, etc.).
*   Angular quantities (Δθ, ω) are often used to describe circular motion.
