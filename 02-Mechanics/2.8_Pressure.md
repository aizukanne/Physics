### 2.8 Pressure

Pressure is defined as the force acting perpendicularly on a unit area of a surface. It quantifies how concentrated a force is.

**Definition and Units**

*   **Pressure (P) = Force (F) / Area (A)**
    *   Where `F` is the magnitude of the force acting perpendicular to the surface area `A`.
*   Pressure is a **scalar quantity**.
*   The SI unit of pressure is the **pascal (Pa)**.
    *   `1 Pa = 1 N/m²` (one newton per square meter)
*   Other common units include:
    *   Atmosphere (atm): Average atmospheric pressure at sea level (1 atm ≈ 101,325 Pa ≈ 1.013 × 10⁵ Pa)
    *   Bar (bar): 1 bar = 100,000 Pa = 10⁵ Pa (very close to 1 atm)
    *   Millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or Torr: Often used for blood pressure or vacuum measurements (1 atm ≈ 760 mmHg)
    *   Pounds per square inch (psi): Commonly used in the US (1 atm ≈ 14.7 psi)

**Pressure in Solids**

When a solid object exerts a force on a surface (e.g., due to its weight), the pressure depends on the object's weight and the area of contact.
*   A smaller contact area results in higher pressure for the same force.
*   *Example:* A sharp knife cuts better than a dull one because the force is concentrated over a smaller area, creating higher pressure. Standing on tiptoes exerts more pressure on the floor than standing flat-footed.

**Pressure in Fluids (Liquids and Gases)**

Fluids exert pressure in all directions. The pressure within a fluid depends on depth, fluid density, and external pressure.

*   **Pressure due to Fluid Depth:** The pressure exerted by a column of fluid of height `h` and uniform density `ρ` is given by:
    *   `P_fluid = ρgh`
    *   Where `g` is the acceleration due to gravity.
    *   This pressure acts equally in all directions at that depth.
*   **Total (Absolute) Pressure at Depth:** The total pressure at a depth `h` in a fluid open to the atmosphere is the sum of the atmospheric pressure (`P_atm`) and the pressure due to the fluid column:
    *   `P_total = P_atm + ρgh`
*   **Gauge Pressure:** The difference between the absolute pressure and atmospheric pressure (`P_gauge = P_total - P_atm = ρgh`). Most pressure gauges measure gauge pressure.

**Pascal's Principle**

*   Pascal's Principle states that a change in pressure applied to an enclosed incompressible fluid is transmitted undiminished to every portion of the fluid and to the walls of the containing vessel.
*   This is the principle behind hydraulic systems (like hydraulic lifts, brakes). A small force applied to a small area piston creates a pressure change that is transmitted through the fluid, resulting in a large force on a large area piston.
    *   `P₁ = P₂` => `F₁ / A₁ = F₂ / A₂` => `F₂ = F₁ (A₂ / A₁)`

**Archimedes' Principle and Buoyancy**

*   Archimedes' Principle states that an object wholly or partially immersed in a fluid experiences an upward buoyant force equal in magnitude to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.
    *   **Buoyant Force (F<0xE2><0x82><0x8B>) = Weight of Displaced Fluid = ρ_fluid × V_displaced × g**
    *   Where `ρ_fluid` is the density of the fluid and `V_displaced` is the volume of the fluid displaced by the object.
*   The buoyant force is responsible for why objects float or feel lighter in fluids.
*   An object will float if the buoyant force equals its weight (`F<0xE2><0x82><0x8B> = W_object`). This happens when the object's average density is less than or equal to the fluid's density.
*   An object will sink if its weight is greater than the buoyant force (`W_object > F<0xE2><0x82><0x8B>`).
*   An object will remain suspended (neutral buoyancy) if its weight equals the buoyant force when fully submerged (`W_object = F<0xE2><0x82><0x8B>` when `V_displaced = V_object`). This happens when the object's average density equals the fluid's density.

**Atmospheric Pressure**

*   The air in the Earth's atmosphere exerts pressure due to its weight.
*   Atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing altitude because there is less air above.
*   Barometers are used to measure atmospheric pressure.

#### Real-World Connections

*   **Hydraulic Systems:** Car brakes, lifts, heavy machinery.
*   **Buoyancy:** Ships floating, submarines diving/surfacing, hot air balloons rising.
*   **Weather:** Atmospheric pressure changes are related to weather patterns.
*   **Medical:** Blood pressure measurements (mmHg).
*   **Diving:** Increased pressure experienced by divers at depth.
*   **Sharp Objects:** Knives, needles exert high pressure due to small area. Snowshoes distribute weight over a large area to reduce pressure.

#### Key Takeaways

*   Pressure is force per unit area (`P = F/A`), measured in Pascals (Pa).
*   Pressure in a fluid increases with depth (`P_fluid = ρgh`).
*   Pascal's Principle: Pressure changes in enclosed fluids are transmitted undiminished (basis of hydraulics).
*   Archimedes' Principle: Buoyant force equals the weight of the displaced fluid (`F<0xE2><0x82><0x8B> = ρ_fluid V_displaced g`).
*   Buoyancy determines whether an object floats, sinks, or is neutrally buoyant based on comparing its weight to the buoyant force (or its density to the fluid density).
