### 2.2 Forces and Newton's Laws

While kinematics describes *how* objects move, dynamics explains *why* they move the way they do. The fundamental concept in dynamics is **force**. Isaac Newton formulated three laws that describe the relationship between forces and motion.

**What is a Force?**

*   A **force** is a push or a pull that can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (i.e., to accelerate).
*   Force is a **vector quantity**, having both magnitude and direction.
*   The SI unit of force is the **newton (N)**. 1 N = 1 kg⋅m/s².

**Types of Forces**

Forces can be broadly categorized:

1.  **Contact Forces:** Act through direct physical contact.
    *   **Normal Force (F<0xE2><0x82><0x99> or N):** The perpendicular support force exerted by a surface on an object in contact with it. It prevents objects from passing through each other.
    *   **Friction (f):** A force that opposes motion (or attempted motion) between surfaces in contact. It acts parallel to the surfaces.
    *   **Tension (T):** The pulling force transmitted axially by means of a string, cable, chain, or similar object.
    *   **Applied Force (F<0xE2><0x82><0x90>):** A general push or pull exerted on an object by another object or person.
    *   **Air Resistance (Drag):** A type of friction that opposes the motion of objects through the air.

2.  **Non-Contact Forces (Field Forces):** Act over a distance without direct physical contact.
    *   **Gravitational Force (F<0xE2><0x82><0x96> or W):** The attractive force between objects with mass. Near Earth's surface, this is the object's **weight** (`W = mg`, where `g` is the acceleration due to gravity).
    *   **Electromagnetic Force:** Forces between electric charges (static electricity) and forces on moving charges in magnetic fields.
    *   *(Strong and Weak Nuclear Forces act within the atomic nucleus and are typically covered in Atomic/Nuclear Physics.)*

**Newton's Laws of Motion**

1.  **Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia):** An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction (constant velocity) unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force (a non-zero **net force**).
    *   **Inertia:** The tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion. Mass is a measure of inertia.
    *   **Net Force (F<0xE2><0x82><0x99><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x9C> or ΣF):** The vector sum of all individual forces acting on an object.

2.  **Newton's Second Law:** The acceleration (**a**) of an object is directly proportional to the net force (**F<0xE2><0x82><0x99><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x9C>**) acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass (`m`).
    *   **ΣF = ma**
    *   This is the fundamental link between force and acceleration. If the net force is zero, the acceleration is zero (constant velocity - consistent with the First Law).

3.  **Newton's Third Law (Action-Reaction):** For every action (force), there is an equal and opposite reaction (force). If object A exerts a force on object B, then object B exerts an equal force in the opposite direction on object A.
    *   **F**<0xE2><0x82><0x90><0xE2><0x82><0x9B> = -**F**<0xE2><0x82><0x9B><0xE2><0x82><0x90>
    *   These forces act on *different* objects and never cancel each other out when considering the motion of a single object.
    *   *Example:* When you push on a wall (action), the wall pushes back on you (reaction). When Earth pulls you down (gravity action), you pull Earth up (gravity reaction).

**Free Body Diagrams (FBDs)**

A crucial tool for applying Newton's laws is the **Free Body Diagram**. It's a simplified diagram showing a single object (represented as a point or box) and all the external forces acting *on that object*, drawn as arrows originating from the object.

*(Placeholder for Image: Create an image file (e.g., `02-2_free_body_diagram_example.png`) in `02-Mechanics/assets/` showing an object (e.g., a block on an inclined plane) and clearly labeled force vectors (Weight, Normal Force, Friction, Applied Force if any). Add using `![Free Body Diagram Example](assets/02-2_free_body_diagram_example.png)`)*

**Equilibrium**

An object is in **equilibrium** if the net force acting on it is zero (ΣF = 0). This means the object is either at rest (static equilibrium) or moving with constant velocity (dynamic equilibrium). In equilibrium, the vector sum of all forces is zero, meaning the forces balance out in all directions.

**Friction**

Friction is a force opposing relative motion between surfaces.

*   **Static Friction (f<0xE2><0x82><0x9B>):** The force that prevents an object from starting to move when an external force is applied. It increases with the applied force up to a maximum value.
    *   `f<0xE2><0x82><0x9B> ≤ μ<0xE2><0x82><0x9B> F<0xE2><0x82><0x99>` (where `μ<0xE2><0x82><0x9B>` is the coefficient of static friction and `F<0xE2><0x82><0x99>` is the normal force).
*   **Kinetic Friction (f<0xE2><0x82><0x96>):** The force that opposes the motion of an object that is already sliding. It's typically constant (or nearly constant) and usually less than the maximum static friction.
    *   `f<0xE2><0x82><0x96> = μ<0xE2><0x82><0x96> F<0xE2><0x82><0x99>` (where `μ<0xE2><0x82><0x96>` is the coefficient of kinetic friction).

*(Placeholder for Image: Create an image file (e.g., `02-2_friction_graph.png`) in `02-Mechanics/assets/` showing a graph of friction force vs. applied force, illustrating the increase of static friction up to a maximum, followed by the constant kinetic friction.

#### Real-World Connections

*   **Vehicle Motion:** Engine provides force, friction (tires, air resistance) opposes motion. Newton's laws govern acceleration and braking.
*   **Structures:** Bridges and buildings must be designed to withstand forces (gravity, wind) and remain in equilibrium.
*   **Sports:** Pushing off the ground (action-reaction), friction between shoes and surface, forces on balls/projectiles.
*   **Rockets:** Expelling gas downwards (action) creates an upward thrust (reaction) according to Newton's Third Law.
