### 2.4 Momentum and Collisions

Momentum is a crucial concept for analyzing objects in motion, especially during interactions like collisions or explosions where forces might be complex and act over short durations.

**Linear Momentum**

*   **Linear Momentum (p)** is a measure of an object's motion, defined as the product of its mass (`m`) and velocity (**v**).
    *   **p** = m**v**
*   Momentum is a **vector quantity**, having the same direction as the velocity.
*   The SI unit of momentum is **kilogram-meter per second (kg⋅m/s)**. (Note: N⋅s is also equivalent).
*   An object can have large momentum if it has a large mass, a large velocity, or both.

**Impulse**

*   **Impulse (J)** is the change in momentum of an object. It's also equal to the product of the average net force (**F**<0xE2><0x82><0x99><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x9C>,avg) acting on an object and the time interval (Δt) over which the force acts.
    *   **J** = Δ**p** = **p**_final - **p**_initial
    *   **J** = **F**<0xE2><0x82><0x99><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x9C>,avg Δt
*   Impulse is a **vector quantity**, having the same direction as the average net force.
*   The SI unit of impulse is the **newton-second (N⋅s)**, which is equivalent to kg⋅m/s.
*   If the force is not constant, impulse is the area under the Force vs. Time graph (`**J** = ∫ **F** dt`).

**Impulse-Momentum Theorem**

This theorem simply restates the definition of impulse:
*   The impulse acting on an object equals the change in the object's momentum.
    *   **F**<0xE2><0x82><0x99><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x9C>,avg Δt = Δ**p** = m**v**_final - m**v**_initial
*   This theorem is particularly useful for analyzing situations involving large forces acting over short times (like collisions or impacts), where calculating the force directly might be difficult, but the change in momentum is measurable.
*   *Example:* Increasing the impact time (Δt) for a given change in momentum (Δp) reduces the average force (F<0xE2><0x82><0x99><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x9C>,avg). This is the principle behind airbags, crumple zones in cars, and bending your knees when landing from a jump.

**Conservation of Linear Momentum**

*   **Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum:** If the net external force acting on a system of objects is zero, the total linear momentum of the system remains constant.
    *   Σ**p**_initial = Σ**p**_initial
    *   (Total momentum before interaction) = (Total momentum after interaction)
*   This principle applies to isolated systems (systems where external forces are negligible compared to internal forces).
*   It is one of the most fundamental conservation laws in physics and holds true even when mechanical energy is not conserved (e.g., in inelastic collisions).

**Collisions**

Collisions are interactions between two or more objects over a short time interval. Momentum is conserved in all types of collisions (assuming the system is isolated). We often classify collisions based on whether kinetic energy is also conserved:

1.  **Elastic Collision:** A collision in which the total kinetic energy of the system is conserved (KE_initial = KE_final). Momentum is also conserved.
    *   Objects bounce off each other without deformation or heat generation.
    *   *Example:* Collisions between billiard balls (approximately elastic).

2.  **Inelastic Collision:** A collision in which the total kinetic energy of the system is *not* conserved (KE_initial > KE_final). Some kinetic energy is transformed into other forms (heat, sound, deformation). Momentum is still conserved.
    *   *Example:* A car crash where vehicles are damaged. A lump of clay hitting the floor.

3.  **Perfectly Inelastic Collision:** A special type of inelastic collision where the objects stick together after colliding and move with a common final velocity. Kinetic energy loss is maximum in this type of collision. Momentum is still conserved.
    *   *Example:* A bullet embedding itself in a block of wood. Two railway cars coupling together.

*(Placeholder for Image: Create an image file (e.g., `02-4_collision_types.png`) in `02-Mechanics/assets/` illustrating the three types of collisions (elastic, inelastic, perfectly inelastic) using simple diagrams of balls before and after colliding. Add using `![Types of Collisions](assets/02-4_collision_types.png)`)*

**Analyzing Collisions (1D Example)**

Consider two objects (masses m₁, m₂) moving along a straight line with initial velocities u₁ and u₂. They collide and move off with final velocities v₁ and v₂.

*   **Conservation of Momentum (Always applies):**
    *   `m₁u₁ + m₂u₂ = m₁v₁ + m₂v₂`
*   **Conservation of Kinetic Energy (Elastic collisions ONLY):**
    *   `½m₁u₁² + ½m₂u₂² = ½m₁v₁² + ½m₂v₂²`

For perfectly inelastic collisions where they stick together (final velocity V):
*   `m₁u₁ + m₂u₂ = (m₁ + m₂)V`

*(Collisions in 2D involve applying conservation of momentum separately for the x and y components.)*

#### Real-World Connections

*   **Vehicle Safety:** Airbags and crumple zones increase impact time (Δt) to reduce force (F) for a given impulse (Δp).
*   **Sports:** Collisions between balls (billiards, bowling), bats and balls, players. Momentum transfer is key.
*   **Rocket Propulsion:** Expelling mass (fuel) backward at high velocity (**v**) gives the rocket forward momentum (**p**).
*   **Particle Physics:** Analyzing collisions in particle accelerators relies heavily on conservation of momentum and energy.

#### Key Takeaways

*   Linear momentum (**p** = m**v**) is a vector measure of motion.
*   Impulse (**J** = **F**<0xE2><0x82><0x99><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x9C>,avg Δt) equals the change in momentum (Δ**p**).
*   Total linear momentum is conserved in an isolated system (Σ**p**_initial = Σ**p**_final).
*   Collisions are classified as elastic (KE conserved) or inelastic (KE not conserved). In perfectly inelastic collisions, objects stick together.
*   Conservation of momentum is the primary tool for analyzing all types of collisions.
