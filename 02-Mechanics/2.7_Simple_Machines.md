### 2.7 Simple Machines

Simple machines are basic mechanical devices that make work easier by changing the magnitude or direction of a force. They form the building blocks of more complex machines. While they don't reduce the total amount of work done (in ideal cases, work input equals work output), they can multiply the input force or change its direction.

**Types of Simple Machines**

There are generally considered to be six types of simple machines:

1.  **Lever:** A rigid bar that pivots around a fixed point called the **fulcrum**. Examples: seesaw, crowbar, wheelbarrow, tweezers. Levers are classified into three classes based on the relative positions of the fulcrum, effort (input force), and load (output force/resistance).
2.  **Wheel and Axle:** Consists of a large wheel attached to a smaller rod (axle) so that they rotate together. Force applied to the wheel creates a larger force (or torque) at the axle, or vice versa. Examples: doorknob, screwdriver handle, steering wheel.
3.  **Pulley:** A wheel on an axle or shaft that is designed to support movement and change of direction of a taut cable or belt, or transfer of power between the shaft and cable or belt. Pulleys can be fixed (change direction of force) or movable (multiply force). Systems of pulleys can provide significant force multiplication.
4.  **Inclined Plane:** A flat supporting surface tilted at an angle, with one end higher than the other. It allows one to raise an object by moving it up the slope with less force than lifting it vertically, but over a greater distance. Examples: ramp, slide.
5.  **Wedge:** Essentially two inclined planes back-to-back, often used to separate two objects or portions of an object, lift up an object, or hold an object in place. Examples: axe head, knife blade, doorstop.
6.  **Screw:** An inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder or cone. It converts rotational motion into linear motion and can be used to fasten materials or lift objects. Examples: screw fastener, jar lid, drill bit.

**Mechanical Advantage (MA)**

Mechanical Advantage is a measure of the force amplification achieved by using a tool, mechanical device or machine system.

*   **Ideal Mechanical Advantage (IMA):** The ratio of the distance over which the effort force acts (`d_e`) to the distance over which the load force acts (`d_l`), assuming no friction or other energy losses.
    *   `IMA = d_e / d_l`
*   **Actual Mechanical Advantage (AMA):** The ratio of the magnitude of the load force (`F_l`) to the magnitude of the effort force (`F_e`). This accounts for real-world factors like friction.
    *   `AMA = F_l / F_e`

In an ideal machine (no friction), `AMA = IMA`. In real machines, `AMA < IMA`.

**Velocity Ratio (VR)**

Velocity Ratio is the same as the Ideal Mechanical Advantage; it's the ratio of the distance moved by the effort to the distance moved by the load in the same time interval.
*   `VR = d_e / d_l = IMA`

**Efficiency (η)**

Efficiency is a measure of how well a machine converts the work input into useful work output. It's often expressed as a percentage.

*   `Work Output (W_out) = F_l × d_l`
*   `Work Input (W_in) = F_e × d_e`
*   **Efficiency (η) = (Work Output / Work Input) × 100%**
*   `η = (F_l d_l / F_e d_e) × 100%`
*   Since `AMA = F_l / F_e` and `VR = d_e / d_l`, efficiency can also be written as:
    *   **η = (AMA / VR) × 100%**

In an ideal machine, `η = 100%`. In real machines, `η < 100%` because some work input is always lost due to friction, deformation, etc. (often dissipated as heat).

**Work Principle for Machines**

Based on the conservation of energy, for an ideal machine (100% efficient):
*   `Work Input = Work Output`
*   `F_e × d_e = F_l × d_l`

For a real machine:
*   `Work Input = Work Output + Work Done Against Friction`

#### Real-World Connections

*   **Tools:** Crowbars, screwdrivers, wrenches, pliers are all based on simple machine principles.
*   **Construction:** Cranes (pulleys, levers), ramps (inclined planes), jacks (screws).
*   **Transportation:** Bicycle gears (wheel and axle, levers), car jacks (screw).
*   **Everyday Items:** Bottle openers (lever), doorknobs (wheel and axle), zippers (wedge), jar lids (screw).

#### Key Takeaways

*   Simple machines change the magnitude or direction of force to make work easier.
*   The six types are lever, wheel and axle, pulley, inclined plane, wedge, and screw.
*   Mechanical Advantage (MA) measures force amplification (`AMA = F_l / F_e`).
*   Velocity Ratio (`VR = d_e / d_l`) equals Ideal Mechanical Advantage (IMA).
*   Efficiency (`η = W_out / W_in = AMA / VR`) measures how much input work becomes useful output work, always less than 100% for real machines due to friction.
