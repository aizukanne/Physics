### 2.3 Work, Energy, and Power

The concepts of work and energy provide an alternative and often powerful way to analyze motion and interactions, especially when forces are not constant.

**Work**

In physics, **work (W)** is done on an object when a force causes a displacement of that object.

*   If a constant force **F** acts on an object causing a displacement **s**, and the angle between the force and displacement vectors is θ, the work done by the force is:
    *   `W = F s cos(θ)`
*   Work is a **scalar quantity**.
*   The SI unit of work is the **joule (J)**. 1 J = 1 N⋅m = 1 kg⋅m²/s².
*   **Key Points about Work:**
    *   Work is done only if the force causes a displacement (if `s = 0`, `W = 0`).
    *   Work is done only by the component of the force parallel to the displacement (hence the `cos(θ)` term). A force perpendicular to the displacement (`θ = 90°`) does no work.
    *   Work can be positive (if force component is in the direction of displacement, `0° ≤ θ < 90°`), negative (if force component opposes displacement, `90° < θ ≤ 180°`), or zero (`θ = 90°`).
*   **Work Done by a Variable Force:** If the force varies, the work done is the area under the Force vs. Displacement graph (`W = ∫ F dx`).

**Energy**

**Energy (E)** is the capacity to do work. Like work, it's a scalar quantity measured in **joules (J)**. There are many forms of energy (thermal, chemical, nuclear, etc.), but in mechanics, we primarily focus on:

1.  **Kinetic Energy (KE or K):** The energy an object possesses due to its motion.
    *   `KE = ½mv²`
    *   Where `m` is the mass and `v` is the speed of the object.
    *   Kinetic energy is always non-negative.

2.  **Potential Energy (PE or U):** Stored energy an object possesses due to its position or configuration within a system where conservative forces act.
    *   **Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE or U<0xE2><0x82><0x96>):** Energy stored due to an object's height `h` above a reference level in a gravitational field `g`.
        *   `GPE = mgh`
        *   The choice of the reference level (`h=0`) is arbitrary; only changes in GPE are physically significant.
    *   **Elastic Potential Energy (EPE or U<0xE2><0x82><0x91>):** Energy stored in a deformed elastic object, like a stretched or compressed spring. For an ideal spring with spring constant `k` displaced by `x` from its equilibrium position:
        *   `EPE = ½kx²`

**Work-Energy Theorem**

This fundamental theorem connects work and kinetic energy:

*   The **net work (W<0xE2><0x82><0x99><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x9C>)** done on an object (the work done by the net force) equals the change in the object's kinetic energy (ΔKE).
    *   `W<0xE2><0x82><0x99><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x9C> = ΔKE = KE_final - KE_initial = ½mv² - ½mu²`

**Conservative and Non-Conservative Forces**

*   **Conservative Force:** A force for which the work done in moving an object between two points is independent of the path taken. Potential energy can only be defined for conservative forces (e.g., gravity, elastic spring force). The work done by a conservative force over a closed loop is zero.
*   **Non-Conservative Force:** A force for which the work done depends on the path taken (e.g., friction, air resistance). Work done by non-conservative forces often dissipates energy as heat.

**Conservation of Mechanical Energy**

*   **Mechanical Energy (E<0xE2><0x82><0x98><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x84>):** The sum of the kinetic and potential energies of a system.
    *   `E<0xE2><0x82><0x98><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x84> = KE + PE`
*   **Principle of Conservation of Mechanical Energy:** If only conservative forces do work within an isolated system, the total mechanical energy of the system remains constant.
    *   `ΔE<0xE2><0x82><0x98><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x84> = ΔKE + ΔPE = 0`
    *   `KE_initial + PE_initial = KE_final + PE_final`
*   If non-conservative forces (like friction) do work (`W<0xE2><0x82><0x99><0xE2><0x82><0x84>`), the total mechanical energy changes:
    *   `W<0xE2><0x82><0x99><0xE2><0x82><0x84> = ΔE<0xE2><0x82><0x98><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x84> = E<0xE2><0x82><0x98><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x84>,final - E<0xE2><0x82><0x98><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x84>,initial`

Add using `![Energy Conservation Example](assets/02-3_energy_conservation_rollercoaster.png)`)*

**Power**

**Power (P)** is the rate at which work is done or the rate at which energy is transferred or transformed.

*   **Average Power:** `P_avg = Work / Time = ΔE / Δt`
*   **Instantaneous Power:** The rate of energy transfer at a specific moment. If a force **F** acts on an object moving with velocity **v**:
    *   `P = dW/dt = **F** ⋅ **v** = F v cos(θ)` (where θ is the angle between **F** and **v**)
*   Power is a **scalar quantity**.
*   The SI unit of power is the **watt (W)**. 1 W = 1 J/s.

#### Real-World Connections

*   **Machines and Engines:** Rated by their power output (e.g., horsepower for cars, watts for appliances).
*   **Human Body:** Muscles do work and expend energy; power output is relevant in activities like running or lifting weights.
*   **Roller Coasters & Pendulums:** Classic examples of the conversion between potential and kinetic energy.
*   **Hydroelectric Dams:** Convert gravitational potential energy of water into electrical energy.

#### Key Takeaways

*   Work is done when a force causes displacement (`W = F s cos(θ)`).
*   Energy is the capacity to do work (measured in Joules). Key forms are Kinetic Energy (`KE = ½mv²`) and Potential Energy (GPE=`mgh`, EPE=`½kx²`).
*   The Work-Energy Theorem states that net work done equals the change in kinetic energy (`W<0xE2><0x82><0x99><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x9C> = ΔKE`).
*   Mechanical energy (`KE + PE`) is conserved if only conservative forces do work. Work done by non-conservative forces changes the total mechanical energy.
*   Power is the rate of doing work or transferring energy (`P = W/t = ΔE/t`, measured in Watts).
