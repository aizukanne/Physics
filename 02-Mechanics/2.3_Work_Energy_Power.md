### 2.3 Work, Energy, and Power

The concepts of work and energy provide an alternative and often powerful way to analyze motion and interactions, especially when forces are not constant.

**Work**

In physics, **work (W)** is done on an object when a force causes a displacement of that object.

*   If a constant force **F** acts on an object causing a displacement **s**, and the angle between the force and displacement vectors is θ, the work done by the force is:
    *   `W = F s cos(θ)`
*   Work is a **scalar quantity**.
*   The SI unit of work is the **joule (J)**. 1 J = 1 N⋅m = 1 kg⋅m²/s².
*   **Key Points about Work:**
    *   Work is done only if the force causes a displacement (if `s = 0`, `W = 0`).
    *   Work is done only by the component of the force parallel to the displacement (hence the `cos(θ)` term). A force perpendicular to the displacement (`θ = 90°`) does no work.
    *   Work can be positive (if force component is in the direction of displacement, `0° ≤ θ < 90°`), negative (if force component opposes displacement, `90° < θ ≤ 180°`), or zero (`θ = 90°`).
*   **Work Done by a Variable Force:** If the force varies, the work done is the area under the Force vs. Displacement graph (`W = ∫ F dx`).

Clearly label the component `F cos(θ)` parallel to **s**. Add using `![Work Done by a Force](assets/02-3_work_done_example.png)`)*

**Energy**

**Energy (E)** is the capacity to do work. Like work, it's a scalar quantity measured in **joules (J)**. There are many forms of energy (thermal, chemical, nuclear, etc.), but in mechanics, we primarily focus on:

1.  **Kinetic Energy (KE or K):** The energy an object possesses due to its motion.
    *   `KE = ½mv²`
    *   Where `m` is the mass and `v` is the speed of the object.
    *   Kinetic energy is always non-negative.

2.  **Potential Energy (PE or U):** Stored energy an object possesses due to its position or configuration within a system where conservative forces act.
    *   **Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE or U<0xE2><0x82><0x96>):** Energy stored due to an object's height `h` above a reference level in a gravitational field `g`.
        *   `GPE = mgh`
        *   The choice of the reference level (`h=0`) is arbitrary; only changes in GPE are physically significant.
    *   **Elastic Potential Energy (EPE or U<0xE2><0x82><0x91>):** Energy stored in a deformed elastic object, like a stretched or compressed spring. For an ideal spring with spring constant `k` displaced by `x` from its equilibrium position:
        *   `EPE = ½kx²`

**Work-Energy Theorem**

This fundamental theorem connects work and kinetic energy:

*   The **net work (W<0xE2><0x82><0x99><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x9C>)** done on an object (the work done by the net force) equals the change in the object's kinetic energy (ΔKE).
    *   `W<0xE2><0x82><0x99><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x9C> = ΔKE = KE_final - KE_initial = ½mv² - ½mu²`

**Conservative and Non-Conservative Forces**

*   **Conservative Force:** A force for which the work done in moving an object between two points is independent of the path taken. Potential energy can only be defined for conservative forces (e.g., gravity, elastic spring force). The work done by a conservative force over a closed loop is zero.
*   **Non-Conservative Force:** A force for which the work done depends on the path taken (e.g., friction, air resistance). Work done by non-conservative forces often dissipates energy as heat.

**Conservation of Mechanical Energy**

*   **Mechanical Energy (E<0xE2><0x82><0x98><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x84>):** The sum of the kinetic and potential energies of a system.
    *   `E<0xE2><0x82><0x98><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x84> = KE + PE`
*   **Principle of Conservation of Mechanical Energy:** If only conservative forces do work within an isolated system, the total mechanical energy of the system remains constant.
    *   `ΔE<0xE2><0x82><0x98><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x84> = ΔKE + ΔPE = 0`
    *   `KE_initial + PE_initial = KE_final + PE_final`
*   If non-conservative forces (like friction) do work (`W<0xE2><0x82><0x99><0xE2><0x82><0x84>`), the total mechanical energy changes:
    *   `W<0xE2><0x82><0x99><0xE2><0x82><0x84> = ΔE<0xE2><0x82><0x98><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x84> = E<0xE2><0x82><0x98><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x84>,final - E<0xE2><0x82><0x98><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x84>,initial`

*(Placeholder for Image: Create an image file (e.g., `02-3_energy_conservation_rollercoaster.png`) in `02-Mechanics/assets/` illustrating a roller coaster car at different points on a track, showing the conversion between GPE and KE while total mechanical energy (ideally) remains constant. Add using `![Energy Conservation Example](assets/02-3_energy_conservation_rollercoaster.png)`)*

**Power**

**Power (P)** is the rate at which work is done or the rate at which energy is transferred or transformed.

*   **Average Power:** `P_avg = Work / Time = ΔE / Δt`
*   **Instantaneous Power:** The rate of energy transfer at a specific moment. If a force **F** acts on an object moving with velocity **v**:
    *   `P = dW/dt = **F** ⋅ **v** = F v cos(θ)` (where θ is the angle between **F** and **v**)
*   Power is a **scalar quantity**.
*   The SI unit of power is the **watt (W)**. 1 W = 1 J/s.

#### Real-World Connections

*   **Machines and Engines:** Rated by their power output (e.g., horsepower for cars, watts for appliances).
*   **Human Body:** Muscles do work and expend energy; power output is relevant in activities like running or lifting weights.
*   **Roller Coasters & Pendulums:** Classic examples of the conversion between potential and kinetic energy.
*   **Hydroelectric Dams:** Convert gravitational potential energy of water into electrical energy.

#### Practice Problems

1. **Basic Level:** A 2 kg block is lifted vertically at constant speed by a force of 25 N through a height of 4 m. Calculate:
   a) The work done by the applied force
   b) The work done by gravity
   c) The net work done on the block
   
   *Solution:*
   a) Work done by applied force = F × d × cos(θ) = 25 N × 4 m × cos(0°) = 100 J
   
   b) Work done by gravity = mg × d × cos(θ) = 2 kg × 9.8 m/s² × 4 m × cos(180°) = -78.4 J
      (cos(180°) = -1 because gravity acts downward, opposite to the displacement)
   
   c) Net work = 100 J + (-78.4 J) = 21.6 J
      (This equals the change in kinetic energy, which is zero since speed is constant)

2. **Intermediate Level:** A 1500 kg car accelerates from rest to 20 m/s. Calculate:
   a) The change in kinetic energy
   b) The net work done on the car
   
   *Solution:*
   a) Initial kinetic energy = ½mv₁² = ½ × 1500 kg × 0² = 0 J
      Final kinetic energy = ½mv₂² = ½ × 1500 kg × 20² = ½ × 1500 × 400 = 300,000 J
      Change in kinetic energy = 300,000 J - 0 J = 300,000 J
   
   b) By the work-energy theorem, net work = change in kinetic energy = 300,000 J

3. **Advanced Level:** A 0.5 kg ball is thrown upward with an initial speed of 15 m/s from a height of 1.5 m above the ground. Calculate:
   a) The maximum height reached by the ball (relative to the ground)
   b) The speed of the ball when it hits the ground
   (Neglect air resistance and take g = 9.8 m/s²)
   
   *Solution:*
   a) Using conservation of energy between the initial position and the highest point:
      Initial energy = KE₁ + PE₁ = ½mv₁² + mgh₁ = ½ × 0.5 × 15² + 0.5 × 9.8 × 1.5
      = 56.25 + 7.35 = 63.6 J
      
      At maximum height: KE₂ = 0 (v₂ = 0), so all energy is potential: PE₂ = mgh₂
      By conservation of energy: 63.6 J = 0.5 × 9.8 × h₂
      h₂ = 63.6/(0.5 × 9.8) = 13 m
   
   b) Using conservation of energy between the initial position and ground level:
      Initial energy = 63.6 J (from part a)
      At ground level: h₃ = 0, so PE₃ = 0, and all energy is kinetic: KE₃ = ½mv₃²
      By conservation of energy: 63.6 J = ½ × 0.5 × v₃²
      v₃² = 63.6/(0.25) = 254.4
      v₃ = 15.95 m/s

4. **Intermediate Level:** A 70 kg person climbs a flight of stairs 5 m high in 25 seconds. Calculate:
   a) The work done against gravity
   b) The power output
   c) The power output in horsepower (1 hp = 746 W)
   
   *Solution:*
   a) Work done = mgh = 70 kg × 9.8 m/s² × 5 m = 3430 J
   
   b) Power = Work/time = 3430 J / 25 s = 137.2 W
   
   c) Power in horsepower = 137.2 W / 746 W/hp = 0.184 hp

5. **Advanced Level:** A 2 kg block slides down a frictionless inclined plane of height 3 m and then along a rough horizontal surface with coefficient of kinetic friction μₖ = 0.2. Calculate how far the block slides along the horizontal surface before coming to rest.
   
   *Solution:*
   Step 1: Find the speed at the bottom of the incline using conservation of energy:
   Initial energy (top of incline) = mgh = 2 kg × 9.8 m/s² × 3 m = 58.8 J
   At bottom of incline, all energy is kinetic: ½mv² = 58.8 J
   v² = 2 × 58.8 J / 2 kg = 58.8 m²/s²
   v = 7.67 m/s
   
   Step 2: Find how far the block slides on the horizontal surface:
   Work done by friction = Fₖ × d = μₖmg × d = 0.2 × 2 kg × 9.8 m/s² × d = 3.92d J
   This work equals the initial kinetic energy: 3.92d = 58.8
   d = 58.8 / 3.92 = 15 m

6. **Intermediate Level:** A 0.2 kg ball attached to a spring with spring constant k = 25 N/m is pulled 10 cm from its equilibrium position and released from rest. Calculate:
   a) The initial elastic potential energy
   b) The maximum speed of the ball
   c) The speed of the ball when it is 5 cm from equilibrium
   
   *Solution:*
   a) Initial elastic potential energy = ½kx² = ½ × 25 N/m × (0.1 m)² = ½ × 25 × 0.01 = 0.125 J
   
   b) At maximum speed (equilibrium position), all energy is kinetic:
      ½mv² = 0.125 J
      v² = 2 × 0.125 J / 0.2 kg = 1.25 m²/s²
      v = 1.118 m/s
   
   c) At 5 cm from equilibrium:
      Elastic potential energy = ½kx² = ½ × 25 N/m × (0.05 m)² = 0.03125 J
      By conservation of energy: KE + PE = 0.125 J
      ½mv² + 0.03125 J = 0.125 J
      ½ × 0.2 kg × v² = 0.09375 J
      v² = 2 × 0.09375 J / 0.2 kg = 0.9375 m²/s²
      v = 0.968 m/s

#### Key Takeaways

*   Work is done when a force causes displacement (`W = F s cos(θ)`).
*   Energy is the capacity to do work (measured in Joules). Key forms are Kinetic Energy (`KE = ½mv²`) and Potential Energy (GPE=`mgh`, EPE=`½kx²`).
*   The Work-Energy Theorem states that net work done equals the change in kinetic energy (`W<0xE2><0x82><0x99><0xE2><0x82><0x8F><0xE2><0x82><0x9C> = ΔKE`).
*   Mechanical energy (`KE + PE`) is conserved if only conservative forces do work. Work done by non-conservative forces changes the total mechanical energy.
*   Power is the rate of doing work or transferring energy (`P = W/t = ΔE/t`, measured in Watts).

#### Common Misconceptions

*   **Misconception:** Work is done whenever a force is applied.
   **Correction:** Work is done only when a force causes displacement. If you push against a wall and it doesn't move, no work is done despite the force being applied. Similarly, if a force is perpendicular to the displacement (like the normal force on a horizontally moving object), no work is done.

*   **Misconception:** Energy can be created or destroyed in physical processes.
   **Correction:** Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another (Law of Conservation of Energy). When energy seems to "disappear" (like in a car braking), it's actually being converted to other forms (like heat). The total energy of an isolated system remains constant.

*   **Misconception:** An object at a higher position always has more potential energy.
   **Correction:** Potential energy depends on both height and the reference level chosen. The choice of where PE = 0 is arbitrary; only changes in potential energy are physically meaningful. For example, an object on the ground floor has higher gravitational potential energy than the same object in a basement, but lower than if it were on the second floor.

*   **Misconception:** Power and energy are the same thing.
   **Correction:** Power is the rate at which energy is transferred or work is done (energy per unit time). Two processes might involve the same amount of energy but different power if they occur over different time periods. For example, walking and running up the same staircase require approximately the same energy but different power outputs.

#### Try It Yourself

**Energy Transformations with a Pendulum**

**Materials needed:**
- String (about 1 meter)
- A small, heavy object (like a metal nut or small ball)
- Ruler or measuring tape
- Stopwatch or smartphone timer
- Protractor (optional)

**Procedure:**
1. Create a simple pendulum by attaching the heavy object to the string
2. Measure the length of the pendulum (L) from the point of suspension to the center of the bob
3. Mark a reference point directly below the suspension point (this will be your zero potential energy reference)
4. Pull the pendulum to the side (about 15-20 degrees from vertical) and release it
5. Observe and time 10 complete oscillations to calculate the period (T = total time/10)
6. Repeat with different initial angles (try 5°, 10°, 15°, 20°) and record the period each time

**Energy Analysis:**
1. At the highest point of the swing, the pendulum has maximum potential energy and minimum kinetic energy
2. At the lowest point (middle of the swing), it has maximum kinetic energy and minimum potential energy
3. Calculate the maximum height (h) of the bob using h = L(1-cos(θ)), where θ is the angle from vertical
4. Calculate the maximum potential energy using PE = mgh
5. Calculate the maximum speed at the bottom using v = √(2gh)

**Questions to Consider:**
- How does the period change (if at all) with different starting angles?
- Where is the energy entirely potential? Entirely kinetic?
- What factors might cause the pendulum to eventually stop swinging?
- How would doubling the mass of the bob affect the energy transformations?
- How would doubling the length of the string affect the period and energy transformations?

#### Historical Note

The concepts of work and energy evolved significantly over centuries. The term "energy" comes from the Greek word "energeia" meaning "activity" or "operation," but its modern scientific meaning developed much later.

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) introduced the concept of "vis viva" (living force), which was defined as mv² and is related to our modern concept of kinetic energy. He argued that this quantity, rather than momentum (mv) as proposed by René Descartes, was conserved in elastic collisions.

The term "work" in its mechanical sense was introduced in the early 19th century by French mathematician Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis (1792-1843) and others. Coriolis defined work as "weight lifted through a height," which evolved into our modern force × displacement definition.

The principle of conservation of energy emerged gradually. In 1842, Julius Robert Mayer (1814-1878) published a paper stating that energy could be neither created nor destroyed, only transformed. James Prescott Joule (1818-1889) experimentally demonstrated the mechanical equivalent of heat, showing that mechanical work could be converted to thermal energy in precise, measurable amounts.

The comprehensive law of energy conservation was formulated by Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) in 1847, unifying various forms of energy (mechanical, thermal, electrical, etc.) under a single conservation principle.

The concept of potential energy was developed by William Rankine (1820-1872) and others in the mid-19th century, completing the framework for analyzing mechanical systems using energy methods rather than forces.

Today, the principles of work, energy, and power are fundamental not only to mechanics but to all branches of physics and engineering, from quantum mechanics to astrophysics, and form the basis for understanding everything from subatomic particles to the evolution of the universe.
