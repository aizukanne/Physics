### 1.1 Importance of Measurement
Physics is an experimental science. To understand the laws of nature, we need to observe and measure physical quantities accurately. Measurement provides the quantitative data necessary to:

*   **Test Hypotheses and Theories:** Experiments are designed to test predictions made by physical theories. Accurate measurements are crucial to determine if experimental results support or contradict a theory.
*   **Establish Relationships:** Measurements allow us to find mathematical relationships between different physical quantities (e.g., how the force on an object relates to its acceleration).
*   **Ensure Reproducibility:** Scientific findings must be reproducible. Precise measurements using standardized units allow scientists worldwide to replicate experiments and verify results.
*   **Enable Technology:** Engineering and technology rely heavily on precise measurements for designing and manufacturing everything from microchips to bridges.

**Physical Quantities:**

A **physical quantity** is any property of a material or system that can be quantified by measurement. Examples include length, mass, time, temperature, force, and velocity.

Physical quantities can be classified into two types:

1.  **Base Quantities (or Fundamental Quantities):** These are a small set of quantities that are considered fundamental and are defined independently. In the International System of Units (SI), there are seven base quantities:
    *   Length
    *   Mass
    *   Time
    *   Electric Current
    *   Thermodynamic Temperature
    *   Amount of Substance
    *   Luminous Intensity
2.  **Derived Quantities:** These are quantities whose definitions are based on combinations of base quantities. Their units are derived from the base units. Examples include:
    *   Area (Length × Length)
    *   Volume (Length × Length × Length)
    *   Speed (Length / Time)
    *   Acceleration (Length / Time²)
    *   Force (Mass × Acceleration = Mass × Length / Time²)
    *   Energy (Force × Distance = Mass × Length² / Time²)

Understanding the distinction between base and derived quantities is essential for working with units and performing dimensional analysis (covered in the next section).
