### 1.2 SI Units
To ensure consistency and allow scientists worldwide to compare results, a standardized system of units is essential. The **International System of Units (SI)** (from the French *Système International d'Unités*) is the modern form of the metric system and the most widely used system of measurement in science and technology.

**SI Base Units:**

The SI system is built upon seven **base units**, each corresponding to one of the base quantities identified in section 1.1:

| Base Quantity             | SI Base Unit | Symbol |
| :------------------------ | :----------- | :----- |
| Length                    | meter        | m      |
| Mass                      | kilogram     | kg     |
| Time                      | second       | s      |
| Electric Current          | ampere       | A      |
| Thermodynamic Temperature | kelvin       | K      |
| Amount of Substance       | mole         | mol    |
| Luminous Intensity        | candela      | cd     |

*Note: While the kilogram is the base unit, prefixes (see below) are often applied to the gram (1 g = 0.001 kg) for convenience.*

**SI Derived Units:**

Units for derived quantities are formed by combining the base units according to the algebraic relationship defining the quantity. Many derived units have special names and symbols.

| Derived Quantity | Relationship with Base Quantities | SI Derived Unit | Symbol | Equivalent Base Units |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------- | :-------------- | :----- | :-------------------- |
| Area             | Length × Length                   | square meter    | m²     | m²                    |
| Volume           | Length × Length × Length          | cubic meter     | m³     | m³                    |
| Speed, Velocity  | Length / Time                     | meter per second| m/s    | m s⁻¹                 |
| Acceleration     | Length / Time²                    | meter per second squared | m/s² | m s⁻² |
| Force            | Mass × Acceleration               | newton          | N      | kg m s⁻²              |
| Energy, Work     | Force × Length                    | joule           | J      | N m = kg m² s⁻²       |
| Power            | Energy / Time                     | watt            | W      | J/s = kg m² s⁻³       |
| Pressure         | Force / Area                      | pascal          | Pa     | N/m² = kg m⁻¹ s⁻²     |
| Frequency        | 1 / Time                          | hertz           | Hz     | s⁻¹                   |
| Electric Charge  | Current × Time                    | coulomb         | C      | A s                   |
| Voltage          | Energy / Charge                   | volt            | V      | J/C = kg m² s⁻³ A⁻¹   |
| Resistance       | Voltage / Current                 | ohm             | Ω      | V/A = kg m² s⁻³ A⁻²   |

**SI Prefixes:**

To handle very large or very small quantities conveniently, the SI system uses prefixes to denote multiples or submultiples of powers of 10.

| Prefix | Symbol | Factor     | Example         |
| :----- | :----- | :--------- | :-------------- |
| giga   | G      | 10⁹        | 1 GWh (gigawatt-hour) |
| mega   | M      | 10⁶        | 2 MJ (megajoules) |
| kilo   | k      | 10³        | 5 km (kilometers) |
| centi  | c      | 10⁻²       | 30 cm (centimeters) |
| milli  | m      | 10⁻³       | 100 mg (milligrams) |
| micro  | µ      | 10⁻⁶       | 50 µs (microseconds) |
| nano   | n      | 10⁻⁹       | 600 nm (nanometers) |
| pico   | p      | 10⁻¹²      | 10 pF (picofarads) |

**Unit Conversions:**

Converting between units is often necessary. This usually involves multiplying by a **conversion factor**, which is a ratio equal to 1.

*Example:* Convert 5 kilometers (km) to meters (m).
We know 1 km = 1000 m. The conversion factor can be written as (1000 m / 1 km) or (1 km / 1000 m). We choose the one that cancels the original unit:
`5 km × (1000 m / 1 km) = 5000 m`

*Example:* Convert 60 miles per hour (mph) to meters per second (m/s).
(Given: 1 mile ≈ 1609 m, 1 hour = 3600 s)
`60 miles/hour × (1609 m / 1 mile) × (1 hour / 3600 s) ≈ 26.8 m/s`

*Example:* Convert 2500 cm³ to m³.
We know 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 m³ = (100 cm)³ = 1,000,000 cm³.
`2500 cm³ × (1 m³ / 1,000,000 cm³) = 0.0025 m³`

**Dimensional Analysis:**

Dimensional analysis is a powerful technique used to check the consistency of equations and derive relationships between physical quantities. It involves treating the dimensions (like Length [L], Mass [M], Time [T]) of quantities as algebraic variables.

*   **Checking Equations:** Both sides of a valid physical equation must have the same dimensions.
    *Example:* Check the equation `distance = speed × time`.
    Dimensions: `[L] = [L/T] × [T] = [L]`. The equation is dimensionally consistent.
    *Example:* Check `v = at` (velocity = acceleration × time).
    Dimensions: `[L/T] = [L/T²] × [T] = [L/T]`. Consistent.
*   **Deriving Relationships:** Dimensional analysis can sometimes help deduce the form of an equation (up to a dimensionless constant).
    *Example:* How does the period (T) of a simple pendulum depend on its length (L) and the acceleration due to gravity (g)?
    Assume `T ∝ Lᵃ gᵇ`. Dimensions: `[T] ∝ [L]ᵃ [L/T²]ᵇ = [L]ᵃ⁺ᵇ [T]⁻²ᵇ`.
    Matching dimensions:
    For [T]: `1 = -2b` => `b = -1/2`
    For [L]: `0 = a + b` => `a = -b = 1/2`
    So, `T ∝ L¹ᐟ² g⁻¹ᐟ² = √(L/g)`. (The constant factor, 2π, cannot be found by dimensional analysis alone).

    *Example:* Check the formula for kinetic energy `KE = 1/2 mv²`.
    Dimensions of KE (Energy = Force × Distance): `[M L²/T²]`
    Dimensions of `1/2 mv²`: `[M] × [L/T]² = [M L²/T²]` (Note: numerical factors like 1/2 are dimensionless).
    The dimensions match, so the formula is dimensionally consistent.

Dimensional analysis is a crucial tool for verifying calculations and understanding the relationships between physical quantities.

#### Real-World Connections

*   **International Trade & Science:** SI units provide a universal language for measurements, facilitating global collaboration and commerce.
*   **Engineering Blueprints:** Standardized units (like millimeters or meters) are essential for accurate design and manufacturing.
*   **Medicine:** Dosages are measured in milligrams (mg) or milliliters (mL), requiring careful use of prefixes.
*   **Computing:** Data storage uses prefixes like kilo, mega, giga, tera (though sometimes based on powers of 2, especially for RAM).

#### Key Takeaways

*   The SI system provides a standardized set of base units (m, kg, s, A, K, mol, cd) for fundamental quantities.
*   Derived units are combinations of base units (e.g., N = kg m/s²).
*   Prefixes denote powers of 10 for scaling units (e.g., kilo = 10³, milli = 10⁻³).
*   Unit conversions use conversion factors (ratios equal to 1) to change units without changing the value.
*   Dimensional analysis uses the dimensions [L], [M], [T], etc., to check equation consistency and derive relationships.
