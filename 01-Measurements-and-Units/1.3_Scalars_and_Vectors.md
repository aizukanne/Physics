### 1.3 Scalars and Vectors
When describing physical quantities, we often need to specify more than just a number and a unit. Some quantities also require a direction. This leads to the classification of physical quantities into scalars and vectors.

**Scalars:**

A **scalar quantity** is a physical quantity that is fully described by its **magnitude** (a numerical value) and its **unit**. It has no direction associated with it.

*   **Examples of Scalars:**
    *   **Distance:** The total path length covered (e.g., 5 km).
    *   **Speed:** How fast an object is moving (e.g., 60 km/h).
    *   **Mass:** The amount of matter in an object (e.g., 2 kg).
    *   **Time:** Duration (e.g., 30 s).
    *   **Temperature:** Degree of hotness or coldness (e.g., 25 °C or 298 K).
    *   **Energy:** Capacity to do work (e.g., 100 J).
    *   **Work:** Energy transferred by a force (e.g., 50 J).
    *   **Power:** Rate of energy transfer (e.g., 60 W).
    *   **Density:** Mass per unit volume (e.g., 1000 kg/m³).
    *   **Volume:** Space occupied (e.g., 2 m³).
    *   **Electric Charge:** (e.g., 1.6 x 10⁻¹⁹ C).

Scalar quantities can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided using ordinary arithmetic rules (provided they have the same units when adding or subtracting).

**Vectors:**

A **vector quantity** is a physical quantity that requires both **magnitude** (with unit) and **direction** to be fully described.

*   **Examples of Vectors:**
    *   **Displacement:** The change in position from a starting point to an ending point, including direction (e.g., 5 km North).
    *   **Velocity:** The rate of change of displacement (speed *and* direction) (e.g., 60 km/h East).
    *   **Acceleration:** The rate of change of velocity (e.g., 9.8 m/s² downwards).
    *   **Force:** A push or a pull (e.g., 10 N upwards).
    *   **Momentum:** Mass times velocity (e.g., 50 kg m/s West).
    *   **Weight:** The force of gravity acting on an object (e.g., 98 N downwards).
    *   **Electric Field:** Force per unit charge (e.g., 200 N/C to the right).
    *   **Magnetic Field:** (e.g., 0.5 T into the page).

Vectors are typically represented graphically by arrows. The length of the arrow represents the magnitude (to scale), and the direction the arrow points indicates the direction of the vector.

Adding, subtracting, and multiplying vectors requires special methods (vector algebra), which will be covered in more detail in Chapter 2 (Mechanics). This section serves as an introduction to the concept and distinction.
