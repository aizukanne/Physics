# High School Physics Textbook (CAIE, CXC, WAEC Aligned)

This repository contains the source files for a comprehensive physics textbook designed for high school students, aligning with the syllabi of CAIE, CXC, and WAEC examination bodies.

## Project Goal

To create an accessible, engaging, and pedagogically sound physics textbook in Markdown format, suitable for online platforms like GitHub Pages or conversion to other formats.

## Structure

The textbook is organized into chapters based on standard physics topics:

*   Chapter 0: Introduction to Physics
*   Chapter 1: Measurements and Units
*   Chapter 2: Mechanics
*   Chapter 3: Thermal Physics
*   Chapter 4: Waves and Optics
*   Chapter 5: Electricity and Magnetism
*   Chapter 6: Atomic and Nuclear Physics
*   Chapter 7: Electronics (Optional)
*   Chapter 8: Astrophysics (Optional)
*   Chapter 9: Practical Skills

Each chapter folder contains a `README.md` file outlining the chapter's content and learning objectives. Detailed content will be added progressively.
