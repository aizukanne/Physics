# High School Physics Textbook (CAIE, CXC, WAEC Aligned)

This repository contains the source files for a comprehensive physics textbook designed for high school students, aligning with the syllabi of CAIE, CXC, and WAEC examination bodies.

## Project Goal

To create an accessible, engaging, and pedagogically sound physics textbook in Markdown format, suitable for online platforms like GitHub Pages or conversion to other formats. The content aims to:

- Present physics concepts clearly and accurately
- Provide engaging real-world applications and examples
- Include appropriate visual aids to enhance understanding
- Offer practice problems with varying difficulty levels
- Support diverse learning styles and approaches

## Structure

The textbook is organized into chapters based on standard physics topics:

*   Chapter 0: [Introduction to Physics](./00-Introduction/README.md)
*   Chapter 1: [Measurements and Units](./01-Measurements-and-Units/README.md)
*   Chapter 2: [Mechanics](./02-Mechanics/README.md)
*   Chapter 3: [Thermal Physics](./03-Thermal-Physics/README.md)
*   Chapter 4: [Waves and Optics](./04-Waves-and-Optics/README.md)
*   Chapter 5: [Electricity and Magnetism](./05-Electricity-and-Magnetism/README.md)
*   Chapter 6: [Atomic and Nuclear Physics](./06-Atomic-and-Nuclear-Physics/README.md)
*   Chapter 7: [Electronics (Optional)](./07-Electronics-Optional/README.md)
*   Chapter 8: [Astrophysics (Optional)](./08-Astrophysics-Optional/README.md)
*   Chapter 9: [Practical Skills](./09-Practical-Skills/README.md)

Each chapter folder contains:
- A `README.md` file outlining the chapter's content and learning objectives
- Individual Markdown files for each section within the chapter
- An `assets` directory for images and diagrams related to the chapter

## Content Development Guidelines

Several documents provide guidance for content development:

- [Content Development Guide](./CONTENT_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md): General guidelines for content creation
- [Content Template](./CONTENT_TEMPLATE.md): Standard template for section content
- [README Template](./README_TEMPLATE.md): Standard template for chapter README files
