## Pedagogical Notes

*(Content will connect concepts to prior knowledge of chemistry/matter (constructivism) and use experiments/simulations for spectra/radioactivity (inquiry-based). Complex concepts will be simplified (cognitive load theory), and mastery of fundamentals ensured (mastery learning). Real-world examples include isotopes in medicine/dating, nuclear power, and industrial uses. Labs involve diffraction gratings/gas tubes for spectra and Geiger counters/simulations for decay. Formative assessments include quizzes, group problem-solving, and reflective journaling.)*
