## Pedagogical Notes

*(Content will connect concepts to everyday heating/cooling experiences (constructivism) and use experiments/simulations for investigation (inquiry-based). Various resources will support different learning styles (differentiated instruction), and mastery of fundamentals will be ensured before advancing (mastery learning). Real-world examples include household appliances, building insulation, and heating/cooling systems. Labs involve calorimetry and gas law apparatus. Formative assessments include quizzes, group problem-solving, and reflective journaling.)*
