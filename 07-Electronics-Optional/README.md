## Pedagogical Notes

*(Content will connect concepts to experiences with electronic devices (constructivism) and use experiments/simulations (inquiry-based). Projects on circuit design/analysis may be assigned (project-based). Real-world examples include smartphones, computers, audio amplifiers, and control systems. Labs involve breadboarding diodes, transistors, and logic gates, and analyzing simple circuits. Formative assessments include quizzes, group problem-solving, and project evaluations.)*
