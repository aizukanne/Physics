## Pedagogical Notes

*(Content will connect concepts to experiences with electrical devices/magnets (constructivism) and use experiments/simulations (inquiry-based). Circuit problem complexity will increase gradually (ZPD/scaffolding), and projects on electrical systems may be assigned (project-based). Real-world examples include household appliances, motors, generators, transformers, and magnetic storage. Labs involve Ohm's/Kirchhoff's laws, magnetic field mapping, and induction. Formative assessments include quizzes, group problem-solving, and project evaluations.)*
